The game for me is the **Wrecking Crew**


I was stuck on making the character move. Therefore, I have nothing on any design patterns. I did basically what TA taught me but it didn't work. It throws back an error saying Object reference not set to an instance of an object. Not sure what is going on, I will talk to TA to find out the problem. All I have right now is a cube for the ground and a capsule for the character.
